                    <h5>Top Ten Questions to Ask a Staffing Agency</h5>
                    If you've been thinking about temporary or contract work, you're not alone. According to the American Staffing Association, every day, 2.9 million people are on assignment with staffing companies. Whether you want a temporary job or a full-time position, working for a staffing agency is a great career move.

                    <strong> Working with a Staffing Agency</strong>
                    To explore whether working with a staffing agency is the right choice for you, here are 10 questions to help you choose a prospective staffing agency:

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>01. Does the staffing agency specialize in my field?</strong>
                    Office managers, receptionists and other administrative skills should seek a staffing agency that focuses on those skills.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong> 02. Does the recruiter have industry-specific experience?</strong>
                    Ensure your recruiter and other members of the firm are tapped into the local community, and have established contacts and gained credibility in the industry.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>   0-3. What's the recruiter's typical process for placing candidates?</strong>
                    An experienced recruiter knows the nuances and challenges involved with locating qualified candidates and matching them with the employer who best meets their needs and lifestyle. A good recruiter makes the job seeker the number one priority.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>    04. How long has the staffing agency been in business?</strong>
                    Staffing is an intricate industry, and one doesn't learn how to succeed in it overnight. Look for a reputable staffing agency that's an established business. Ask around to friends and colleagues. Word-of-mouth is how good recruiters get most of their business.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>   05. How are you treated during the initial contact?</strong>
                    Were you greeted politely on the phone? What was the atmosphere in the office when you visited? Make sure the staffing agency and its workers are pleasant to deal with and knowledgeable.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>    06. Does the staffing agency fully understand your needs?</strong>
                    Are you a parent who wants to work a flexible schedule? Maybe you're a recent college grad who wants to "try out" companies before committing to one. Or an experienced office manager seeking your next full-time position. Make sure the staffing agency has the types of jobs that will meet your lifestyle.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>   07. How many openings does the staffing agency currently have for the position you seek?</strong>
                    Will you have choices? Does the staffing agency have ten jobs that match your skills, or just one?

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>   08. Does the staffing agency have jobs where you want to be?</strong>
                    A local presence is critical. Local businesses know other business owners in the area. There's a higher likelihood that the staffing agency will have a variety of jobs at both large corporations and smaller businesses, which means more options for you.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>   09. How well run is the organization?</strong>
                    This will reflect the quality of help you receive. Call references. Ask how satisfied they were with the employees at the staffing agency as well as with the assignments they received, whether temporary or full-time.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>    10. What are your responsibilities for a potential position?</strong>
                    If the staffing agency has positions for you, review the basic job duties and objectives with your staffing manager.
